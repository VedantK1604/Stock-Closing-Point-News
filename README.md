<h1>Stock-Closing-Point-News</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Stock Closing Point News project repository! This project is aimed at fetching the closing points of various stocks and providing relevant news articles using Python. By combining stock market data with the latest news, this project aims to assist users in making more informed decisions related to their investments.</p>

stocks. This information is presented in a user-friendly manner, allowing users to quickly analyze both the financial data and the latest news affecting their investment 
interests.</p>
